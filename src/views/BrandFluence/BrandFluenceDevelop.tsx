                During the development phase, our achievement is the establishment of our Minimum Viable Productâ€”converting social media engagement (such as liking posts, commenting, sharing, and following influencers) into tangible rewards. This functionality motivates users to actively engage with influencer content, fostering a mutually advantageous relationship for both users and influencers. As influencers gain traction, they receive monetization not only from the social media platform but also through brand partnerships. Similarly, when user engagement translates into visiting the brand's website or making purchases, the brand also enjoys significant benefits.

                An interaction diagram is a visual representation that illustrates the flow of interactions between different components or objects within a system. In the context of UI/UX design and development, an interaction diagram helps designers map out how users will navigate through an interface, interact with various elements, and progress through different states or screens.

                A high-level campaign in a designer's process involves developing a strategic and overarching plan that outlines the key objectives, messaging, and visual elements to convey a cohesive brand story or promote specific features within an app. It serves as a comprehensive guide for designers to align various design elements, user interactions, and promotional efforts, ensuring a unified and impactful user experience.
