                Our achievement in the development phase is our indispensable Minimum Viable Productâ€”the Safe Route Planner. This feature empowers users with more than just navigation; it ensures they embark on the safest possible journey.

                Unlike common misconceptions associating the fastest route with safety, our Safe Route Planner goes above and beyond. It meticulously considers various factors, including well-lit streets, crime statistics, public spaces, proximity to emergency services, and the presence of surveillance cameras. This thorough analysis ensures that users are guided not merely to their destination but along a path carefully curated for their safety. It's a testament to our commitment to providing a comprehensive and secure navigation experience, where sometimes, opting for the slightly longer route is the smarter choice.
